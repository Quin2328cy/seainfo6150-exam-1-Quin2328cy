      <h1>Question 4. Why is it important to mark up your content semantically?</h1>
      <p>We talked about this during week 2. Write up your answer below and mark it up with at least one paragraph tag.</p>
      <p>Use the word &ldquo;semantic&rdquo; somewhere in your answer and mark up that word as both strong and emphasized.</p>
      <p>
          <b><i>Semantic</i></b> markup is a way of writing and structuring your HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) so that it reinforces the <b><i>semantics</i></b>, 
          or meaning, of the content rather than its appearance. 
          In a broader sense, it means that your site architecture separates presentation from content; 
          essentially saying that HTML is used for structure and CSS is used for the style of your web design.
      </p>
      <p>
          <b><i>Semantics</i></b> and accessibility are a part of HTML by design, but they are not useful unless they are implemented correctly. 
          Writing <b><i>semantic</i></b> markup means understanding the hierarchy of your content and how both users and machines will read it. 
          Much of it can seem like common-sense; when you write a heading, mark it with a heading tag (<h1>, <h2>, etc.). 
            When you write a paragraph, mark it with a paragraph tag (<p>). 
              <b><i>Semantic</i></b> markup means that HTML tags are never chosen based on the way they appear in a web browser 
              — they’re chosen based on the importance and structure of the content.
